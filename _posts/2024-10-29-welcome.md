Welcome to Music with [Pharo](https://pharo.org/)! This blog is dedicated to [Coypu](https://github.com/lucretiomsp/Coypu), [Phausto](https://github.com/lucretiomsp/phausto), and [Pharo-sound](https://github.com/pharo-contributions/pharo-sound) â€” three packages developed for programming music on-the-fly, designing synthesizers and effects as Digital Signal Processors, and handling [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) messages in the Pharo programming language.

Here, you'll find manuals, tutorials, examples, insights, updates on workshops, live performances, activities, and a blog discussing the challenges of developing these packages and APIs.
