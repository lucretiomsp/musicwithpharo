We had the great opportunity to present Phausto during the online poster session of the **[Audio Developer Conference (ADC) 2024](https://audio.dev/conference/)** in Bristol. ADC is a premier event for audio developers, bringing together professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts from across the globe to discuss innovations in audio software, technology, and design.
Over the two-day event, we interacted with over 50 groups and had 15 one-on-one discussions with developers and students from all around he world. 
We received a warm positive feedback about Phausto. Its simplicity and the ease of exporting to a **[Cmajor plugin](https://cmajor.dev/)** were particularly appreciated. Many attendees also praised the Pharo Iceberg integration and the intuitive class browser, which make developing with Phausto a seamless and enjoyable experience.
We’re grateful to ADC for the the opportunity to  share our work and connect with such a vibrant community.  We hope to participate again next year—in person—with a talk!
