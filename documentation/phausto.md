title: "Phausto: fast and accesible DSP programming"
---
Phausto is a Pharo package and API crafted to enable fast and accessible Digital Signal Processor (DSP) design. It is powered by an embedded [Faust](https://faustdoc.grame.fr/) engine, granting users direct access to cutting-edge algorithms that researchers worldwide have implemented into the Faust standard libraries.
Thanks to its exporter methods, Phausto allows synthesisers and effect built within Pharo in a [CMajor] patch or on a [Bela](https://bela.io/) board.
